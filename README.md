# CS50 in Zig

This repository contains my solutions to Harvard’s [CS50](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/)
problem sets where everything is implemented in [Zig](https://github.com/ziglang/zig).

Even the distribution code provided by CS50 has been rewritten in Zig.

## Motivation

I’m trying to learn zig, and CS50’s problem sets range from basic algorithms to memory management,
which helps to learn a language in a deeper level.

## Running the Code

Most of the programs can be run directly with:

```console
zig run filename.zig -- [args]
```

or using the build system:

```bash
zig build run -- [args]
```

## Notes

- Please respect [Harvard’s academic honesty policy](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2024/honesty/).
  This repository is intended for educational purposes and should **not** be used to
  submit work for CS50.

## Repository Structure

- Each folder corresponds to a CS50 problem set (pset1, pset2, …)
- Solutions are organized to closely match the original CS50 problem layout.
